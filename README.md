# Responsive HTML Email for Adidas  

My challenge was to build a **fully responsive HTML email** for Adidas while ensuring compatibility across all major email clients, including Outlook. The goal was to create a visually appealing, well-structured email that adheres to Adidas' branding guidelines.  

The email supports:  

- Proper rendering in **Outlook, Gmail, Apple Mail**, and other email clients  
- **Responsive design** for seamless display on mobile, tablet, and desktop  
- **Table-based layout** to ensure consistent formatting across platforms  
- **Optimized, lightweight code** for fast loading  

## Technologies:  
**HTML, CSS (Inline & Embedded), Table-Based Layout**
